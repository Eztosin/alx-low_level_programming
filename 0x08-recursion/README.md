0x08. C - Recursion

This is a project that handles recursion in C programming language.
Recursion is when a function calls itself directly or indirectly.
The following projects were handled in this concept:
-A function that prints a string, followed by a new line.
Prototype: void _puts_recursion(char *s);

-A function that prints a string in reverse.
Prototype: void _print_rev_recursion(char *s);

-A function that returns the length of a string.
Prototype: int _strlen_recursion(char *s);

-A function that returns the factorial of a given number.
Prototype: int factorial(int n);
If n is lower than 0, the function should return -1 to indicate
an error.
