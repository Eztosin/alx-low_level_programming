0x08. C - Recursion

This is a project that handles recursion in C programming language.
Recursion is when a function calls itself directly or indirectly.
The following projects were handled in this concept:
- A function that prints a string, followed by a new line.
Prototype: void _puts_recursion(char *s);
- Write a function that prints a string in reverse.
Prototype: void _print_rev_recursion(char *s);
